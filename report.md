# Holiday Movies Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to explore and uncover insights about holiday-themed movies using the [TidyTuesday 2023-12-12 Holiday Movies](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2023/2023-12-12/readme.md) release. It includes information from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and specifically focuses on films with titles containing keywords such as "holiday", "Christmas", "Hanukkah", or "Kwanzaa", as well as their variants.

This data set is significant because holiday films are a unique genre that generally reflects cultural trends, seasonal demand by audiences, and production trends. Through the analysis of this data set, we could observe holiday films' evolution over time in their genre, quality (measured through ratings), and production numbers. However, there are certain issues with the data set. For instance, it only includes movies with specified keywords in their titles, potentially leaving out some suitable films. Furthermore, user-generated IMDb ratings can be prone to bias and at times fail to reflect the overall value of the film. With these limitations in mind, the dataset does offer an opportunity to study holiday movie trends and trends.
